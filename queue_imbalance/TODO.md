# TODO
0. run on test!

0. learning curve, check the params for different data lengths
1. validation curve 

1. pick parameters for these 20 stocks with 5050 data separately - check the length of that data
2. apply these parameters to all other stocks
3. compare WITH LOGISTIC RES for the same data - cv?
4. plot data amount diff with results fior the worst for 5050
5. put kernel to the clustering stuff 

## Todo
0. rewrite conclusions for all notebooks with large tick data
1. stock characteristic describe - separate notebook
2. how to pick a kernel and params
3. heat map for rbf kernel params C and gamma
4. sigmoid kernel - how to choose parameters

## Done
0. write conclusions for sigmoid, poly, summary, large tick
5. Fix written stuff for summary_large_tick
6. Fix all md stuff for new notebooks
3. Learn about SVM from coursera
0. reverse large stock lists
0. Use time prediction +1
1. Clean data - use only data from 9-15 
2. Plot queue imbalance vs mid price indicator as dots
3. Fix the conclusions
4. Use SVM

0. Pick top X best stocks
1. Pick top X worst stocks
